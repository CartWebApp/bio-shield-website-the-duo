**Day 1**
Today was just some basic research and planning nothing special.
1. I did some market research on different mosquito repellent brand websites (https://bens30.com/, https://off.com/en-us etc)
2. I drew a wireframe to plan out what the store would look like in the future
3. Started using some AI to generate a few logo ideas and settled on one. Here are the prompts: 

_My prompts for images in adobe firefly_: 
- "make a mosquito logo with a blue lightning bolt behind it"
-  "mosquito repellent logo, mosquito silhouette with a blue lightning bolt passing through it" ( this prompt was the one we settled with )
- "mosquito repellent logo, mosquito silhouette with a gren lightning bolt passing through it"
- "all natural mosquito repellent logo, mosquito silhouette with a gren lightning bolt passing through it"
- "generate a logo for an all natural mosquito repellent, mosquito silhouette with a sky blue lightning bolt passing through it, no text"

**Day 2**
Today I made some progress on generating the website using ChatGPT. Prompts:
_Me and ChatGPT's convo_:
- **Me**: "Look at this wireframe and generate a website based on it"
- **ChatGPT**: "Done ‚Äî I created a full single-file HTML/CSS/JS website in the canvas titled Wireframe-website. Open the canvas (file: wireframe-website.html) to view, edit, and download the page. If you want changes (colors, fonts, layout tweaks, add real images, or convert to React/Tailwind), tell me which and I'll update it: {code}"
- **Me**: "make the other tabs like the contact us page, the cart page etc"
- **ChatGPT**: "I added the Contact Us and Cart pages, plus navigation so you can switch between Home, Products, About Us, Contact, and Cart. The cart system works ‚Äî products can be added and the total updates automatically. Want me to also make a Checkout page with shipping/payment form, or keep it simple? {code}"
- **Me**: "go back to the first version"
- **ChatGPT**: "I‚Äôve reverted the site back to the first version that matches your original wireframe ‚Äî with the hero, mission, section, and best-sellers layout. Do you want me to also add placeholder navigation pages (like Contact, About, Cart) as empty sections, or just leave them as links for now? {code}"
- **Me**: "yes add placeholder navigation pages"
- **ChatGPT**: "I‚Äôve added placeholder navigation pages for Products, About Us, Contact Us, and Cart. Each link now switches the main content area to its placeholder section. Do you want me to also add a basic layout template for these pages (like a hero + text + image), or keep them as plain placeholders? {code}"
*end*

**Day 3**
I made more progress generating the site with ChatGPT, also edited logo with Photoshop and started generating the images of the products; starting with ChatGPT but switching to Gemini:
- **Me**: "{the code the other prompt with chatgpt generated} with this code, create a about us page for it in a about.html file"
- **ChatGPT**: "Got it üëç You want me to take the same style and layout you used for index.html and make an about.html file that matches your BioShield theme. I‚Äôll keep the sidebar, hero, and footer consistent, but swap in new content for the "About us" page. Here‚Äôs a complete about.html: {code}"
-  **Me**: "{the code the other prompt with chatgpt generated} with this code, create a about us page for it in a products.html file"
-  **ChatGPT**: "I‚Äôll spin up a products.html page that matches the style of your main site. It‚Äôll reuse the same sidebar, branding, and layout, but instead of a hero + mission, it‚Äôll focus on a product catalog grid with cards for each item:{code}"
- **Me**: "{the code the other prompt with chatgpt generated} with this code, create a about us page for it in a contact.html file"
- **ChatGPT**: "Here‚Äôs a contact.html page that matches your site‚Äôs design. It includes:
-- A contact form (name, email, message, and send button).
-- A contact info card with email, phone, and address.
-- Full styling consistent with your index.html file: {code}"
*end*

Started generating products on a different prompt:
- **Me**: "generate a bug repellent laundry detergent"
- **ChatGPT**: *image*
- **Me**: "Remake it but with this logo"
- **ChatGPT**: "Got it ‚Äî you want me to remake the product mockups but replace the current branding with this logo you just uploaded, right?"
- **Me**: "yes"
- **ChatGPT**: *image*
- **Me**: "remake the spray with that branking"
- **ChatGPT**: *image*
- **Me**: "make it a personal spray mist not a big bottle"
-  **ChatGPT**: *EXACT same image*
*end*

Chat with Gemini:
- **Me**: "create herbal soap for a bug/mosquito repellent company called bioshield based on this logo. Don't make the bar itself blue, make it a natural color while the packaging outside is ble"
-  **Gemini**: *image*
- **Me**: "Make the background more white"
-  **Gemini**: *image*
-  **Me**: "I meant transparent"
-  **Gemini**: *Fake png background image*
*end*

**Day 4** 
Another chat with Gemini:
- **Me**: "generate a bug and mosquito repelling laundry detergent for a website's product page with this logo and style provided {img}"
-  **Gemini**: *image*
-  **Me**: "remove the background and the buttons and stars in the corner"
-  **Gemini**: *image*
-  **Me**: "get rid of the base its standing on"
-  **Gemini**: *image*
-  **Me**: "make a mini spray bottle based on that design too"
-  **Gemini**: *image*
-  **Me**: "generate a roll-on guard based on this design"
-  **Gemini**: *image*
-  **Me**: "generate mosquito and bug repelling outdoor candles based on this design"
-  **Gemini**: *image* 
-  **Me**: "create a pet spray based on this design"
-  **Gemini**: *image*
- **Me**: "remove the background"
-  **Gemini**: *image*
-  **Me**: "create a bite relif gel based on this design"
-  **Gemini**: *image*
- **Me**: "create a diffuser oil blend based on this design"
-  **Gemini**: *image*
-  **Me**: "by the way this is the soap. use the animal spray, the soap, the bite gel, candles, detergent, diffuser oil, mini spray, and roll-on only {img}"
-  **Gemini**: *image*
*end*

We start plugging in the pictures inside the website. The website starts to look better and better.
**Day 5 to end**
This is the final stage of the project where AI wasn't used and we were doing some stuff ourselves
1. We finish plugging in the pictures we had generated
2. We separate the CSS and the HTML to make code more visible; it was all in the same index.html.
3. We fix some CSS issues that we had causing problems with some of the images and the layout of the different pages.
--  On Rob's end I think he used ChatGPT to understand what some problems were with the css but I don't have the prompts
4. Did some finishing touches on the website and started doing the reflection

**Summary**
Just to sum this up, we used AI to: 
1. Generate code that we used to make the website
2. Generate the images of the products and the logo
3. Edit the images and refine them
4. Understand why the AI generated what it generated

(sorry if this is too long there's a lot of prompts)
